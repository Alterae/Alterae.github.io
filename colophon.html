        </header>
        <p>
          alterae.github.io is currently hosted on
          <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, and the source
          code is available
          <a href="https://github.com/alterae/alterae.github.io">on GitHub</a>.
          At the moment, the entire site is built using plain
          <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, though that is
          likely to change as it grows and I wind up needing a templating system
          of some kind.
        </p>
        <p>
          The styling is all done using vanilla
          <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, and unlike the
          <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> I have no plans to
          change that. I have tried a few
          <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>
          frameworks and I did not enjoy using them. Responsive design and dark
          mode support are supported through the use of media queries, with no
          JavaScript whatsoever.
        </p>
        <p>
          The core principles behind the whole design are that the site should
          be simple, accessible, aesthetically pleasing, and responsive. It
          should show an attention to detail, provide a good reading experience,
          and work on a widen range of devices, with minimal maintenance burden.
        </p>
        <h2>Typography</h2>
        <p>
          This website’s body text is set in
          <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/source-serif-4"
            >Source Serif 4</a
          >, which was chosen because it is readable, aesthetically pleasing,
          has broad support for OpenType features, and is free.
        </p>
        <!-- I'm sorry for the inline styles. -->
        <aside style="font-family: 'Source Serif 4'">
          the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog<br />
          THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG<br />
          1234567890 `~!@#$%^&amp;*()-_=+[]{}\|;:'",.&lt;&gt;/?
        </aside>
        <p>
          Headings are set in bold
          <a href="https://www.ibm.com/plex/"
            ><abbr title="International Business Machines">IBM</abbr> Plex
            Serif</a
          >. While too regular to make for pleasant body text, the bold variant
          is clean, visually distinct from the body text font, and almost has a
          slab serif vibe to it.
        </p>

        <p>
          <code>Code</code> is set in the wonderful
          <a href="https://input.djr.com/">Input Mono</a>, which is reminiscent
          of the typewriter fonts used in older programming books. The large
          punctuation marks and other details make it extremely readable when
          used to display source code, and it is my font of choice for code
          editors and terminals.
