          <h1>Another Static Site Generator</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
          Last month, instead of focusing on university, I spent a fair amount
          of time working on <a href="/mksite">mksite</a>, a static site
          generator. Was this the best use of my time? Absolutely not. Did I
          finish writing it? Not really. Was it an interesting and informative
          experience nonetheless? Absolutely.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h2>Why?</h2>
          <p>
            Why did I do this? Does the world really need yet another static
            site generator? Don’t we already have
            <a href="https://jamstack.org/generators/">plenty?</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, the world at large probably doesn’t need this, but I do. I’ve
            tried a lot of static site generators over the years, and not one of
            them has really worked in a way I actually like, so I decided to
            write something that would suit my (admittedly somewhat specific)
            needs and wants:
          </p>

          <h3>Minimal config with sane defaults</h3>
          <p>
            When I’m making a website, the last thing I want to do is fiddle
            with a lot of settings before I can actually do anything. I wanted
            to build a tool which would do the correct<sup
              ><a id="ref:1" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup
            >
            thing right out of the box.
          </p>

          <h3>Not limited to markdown</h3>
          <p>
            Markdown is wonderful, but it has some serious limitations is far
            from the only format I want to author content in (I’m writing this
            blog post in plain HTML, for example.) And even when I am writing
            markdown, a lot of static site generators rely on their own built-in
            markdown processors, which is a problem if I want to use features of
            a different markdown dialect, or simply prefer one parser over
            another.
          </p>

          <h3>Arbitrary input formats</h3>
          <p>
            Obviously most websites are made of html files, but it would be nice
            to plug in other arbitrary asset processing and output pages and
            other files in whatever format I please.
          </p>
