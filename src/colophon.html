      <h1>About this website</h1>
    </header>

    <p>
      alterae.github.io is currently hosted on
      <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, and the source code
      is available
      <a href="https://github.com/alterae/alterae.github.io">on GitHub</a>. At
      the moment, the entire site is built using plain
      <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, with some added Tera
      templating processed via <a href="/mksite"><code>mksite</code></a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      The styling is all done using vanilla
      <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, and I have no plans to
      change that. I have tried a few
      <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>
      frameworks and I did not enjoy using them. Responsive design and dark mode
      support are supported through the use of media queries, with no JavaScript
      whatsoever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The core principles behind the whole design are that the site should be
      simple, accessible, aesthetically pleasing, and responsive. It should show
      an attention to detail, provide a good reading experience, and work on a
      wide range of devices, with minimal maintenance burden.
    </p>

    <h2>Typography</h2>
    <p>
      This websiteâ€™s body text is set in
      <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/source-serif-4">Source Serif 4</a>,
      which was chosen because it is readable, aesthetically pleasing, has broad
      support for OpenType features, and is free.
    </p>
    <!-- I'm sorry for the inline styles. -->
    <aside style="font-family: 'Source Serif 4', serif">

      THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG<br />
      1234567890 `~!@#$%^&amp;*()-_=+[]{}\|;:'",.&lt;&gt;/?
    </aside>
    <p>
      Headings are set in bold
      <a href="https://www.ibm.com/plex/"
        ><abbr title="International Business Machines">IBM</abbr> Plex Serif</a
      >. While too regular to make for pleasant body text, the bold variant is
      clean, visually distinct from the body text font, and almost has a slab
      serif vibe to it.

    <p>
      <code>Code</code> is set in the wonderful
      <a href="https://input.djr.com/">Input Mono</a>, which is reminiscent of
      the typewriter fonts used in older programming books. The large
      punctuation marks and other details make it extremely readable when used
      to display source code, and it is my font of choice for code editors and
      terminals.
